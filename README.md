# Enhanced YOLO with Spectral Recalibration for Accurate and Real-Time Sign Language Detection

**Abstract:**  
Sign language serves as a vital communication medium for individuals with hearing impairments, yet conventional convolutional architectures often suffer from significant feature degradation, particularly in high-frequency details and multi-scale feature representation. This paper introduces a novel method, **YOLO-FPD**, which leverages Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to construct a dual-domain decoupled feature representation framework. A **Parallel Frequency-domain Attention Module (PFMLP)** is integrated to dynamically enhance key responses in both frequency and spatial domains, while a **Dynamic Heterogeneous Multi-scale Cross-stage Fusion Module (DHMCS-FM)** is proposed to improve multi-scale and high-frequency gesture feature capture.Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that YOLO-FPD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (**mAP@50 of 93.2% on the ASL dataset and 92.4% on the Expression dataset**) while maintaining real-time performance, outperforming several mainstream models.Our approach not only addresses the challenges of high-frequency detail loss and multi-scale feature representation but also establishes a collaborative mechanism between frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing, paving the way for more robust and efficient sign language recognition systems.
